## I'm Cleb! Welcome to my Github Page


### About Me
Learned from hands-on experience with computers from an early age. Over time, my interest grew to learning about computer hardware, how to construct computers, basic networking principals, and eventually switching my major in college from networking and info-sec to application development. Currently working as a SysAdmin and eager to learn more.
