## I'm Cleb! Welcome to my Github Page


### About Me
Learned from hands-on experience with computers from an early age. As I got older, my interest pushed me to learning about more about computer hardware, building computers, basic networking principals, and eventually switching my major from networking and info-sec to application development. Started my journey with Vim and the command line in January 2024 and have loved it ever since. Currently working as a SysAdmin and eager to learn more about anything I can.
